## BlueprintModels

These models are used to communicate between MAPI and the native apps. This repository defines the Swift models for "blueprint" collections, generated from the protobuf [schema](https://github.com/guardian/mobile-apps-api-models/blob/main/proto/blueprint.proto) with the help of [SwiftBuffet](https://github.com/guardian/swift-buffet).
